# ðŸš€ Parkinson's Disease Detection using Machine Learning
ðŸŒŸ Overview
Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor functions, leading to symptoms like tremors, stiffness, and bradykinesia. Early detection is crucial for effective management.
This project leverages machine learning techniques to detect Parkinson's disease using biomedical voice measurements. The goal is to develop a non-invasive, accurate, and cost-effective diagnostic tool.
